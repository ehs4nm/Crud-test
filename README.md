# Laravel CRUD Test Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of my Laravel CRUD Test Assignment. The assignment includes various tasks related to Test-Driven Development (TDD), Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), Clean Architecture, and other stuff (all nice challenging ðŸ˜ƒ). The goal of the assignment is to showcase your understanding and proficiency in these areas. 
I have gathered some steps i've done here:

# Project Structure Overview
Understanding the project structure is essential for maintaining and extending the codebase. Here's an overview of the key directories in the project:
  - App
      - Adapters
          - Presenters
          - ViewModels
      - Application
          - DTO
          - Mappers
          - UseCases
          - Customer
              - Commands
              - Queries
      - Domains
          - Factories
          - Interfaces
          - Models
          - ValueObjects
      - Exceptions
      - Http
          - Controllers
          - Middleware
      - Providers
      - Repositories


Please note that I haven't separated the presentation layer, and all tests are currently in the default Laravel folder. In the future, I might consider placing them within each corresponding layer of the application. The "Adapters" folder is also there for any chance i get to do refactoring needed. I used various resources to adapt the Clean Architecture structure.

I've put a lot of effort into researching and deciding on the architecture (CA). However, I acknowledge that there is still more work and updates needed, especially in addressing the missing presentation layer. I've made a few choices in the implementation, and I plan to continue refining and improving it.

Regarding event sourcing, I have attempted to incorporate the concept of Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). It has been a bit challenging, and unfortunately, due to a looming deadline for task delivery, I haven't been able to dedicate as much time to it as I would have liked. However, I recognize its importance and plan to invest more time in exploring and working on it in the future.

## TEST RESULTS
Throughout the project, various aspects have been thoroughly tested. Here are the test results:

# HOW TO USE THE CODE BASE
To get started with the code base, follow these instructions:

##UP AND RUNNING

You can run the entire project as a container using the following commands:

    # for the first time use 
    docker-compose build
    # then run up -d run containers in a dispatched mode
    docker-compose up -d
